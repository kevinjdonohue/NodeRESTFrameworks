# Node.js RESTful Frameworks

A repo for playing with several different Node.js based frameworks -- for the purpose of (potentially) finding a replacement for (just) Express.js.

As we are beginning to experiment with writing simple RESTful web services in Node.js (using just Express.js) at work, I'm on a journey to discover if there are other Node.js libraries, frameworks, etc. that can help us create new services both quickly and effectively.  I'm interested in things such as error handling, keeping things DRY, etc.
